### Locations for things

- Site: {PRODUCTION_URL}
- Repo: {REPO_URL}
- Clone URL: {REPO_CLONE_URL}
- Issue list: {PROJECT_BOARD_URL}
- Database: {CONSOLE_URL}

### Project cadence & duration

The project is expected to take 6 hours per week for 10 weeks.

Each week, the following will happen:

- The whole team will gather at the beginning of the week for a Weekly Sync meeting.
- The team of 4 developers will split into 2 pairs of 2 developers each and each pair will take on a story from the issues list to work on together that week.
- Developers will have learning modules to consume asynchronously.
